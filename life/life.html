                <p>I was born and raised in North Ogden, UT. I was first introduced to programming when I was just 9 years old, when my parents purchased a T.I.99/A4. I enjoyed playing the games that my parents had come with it, but then I started reading the manual (yes, I was that kind of kid) and I found that I could write my own programs on the 99/A4. So, I taught myself T.I.'s version of BASIC and I was hooked. In high school I took the complete series of computer science classes offered including A.P. my senior year. As a young person I couldn't see software industry was about to explode, and became a nurseâ€™s aide after graduation. In 1997 I got married and a year later I joined the US Air Force.</p>
                <p>I served 15 years in the Air Force as an Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technician. I learned a great deal about chemistry, physics, physiology, biology, meteorology, and psychology. Nearly every discipline was pertinent to defeating unexploded ordnance, whether chemical, biological, nuclear, conventional or improvised. The movie "The Hurt Locker" is loosely based on the role of EOD Techs. I learned a great deal in the Air Force that has prepared me for work in the corporate world. Intense management and leadership training is fundamental to my success as an Airman. I served as Information Security Manager, Training Section Assistant Manager, Plans and Intelligence Superintendent, and Logistics Specialist within my unit. As an EOD Tech, I also had to know a great deal about electronics and robotics and went through several specialized courses for each.</p>
                <p>After my time in the Air Force I was ready for a change. I thought about going back to the medical professions but my body was too worn out to try nursing again. Then my very intelligent wife reminded my what a natural I am with computers and software. I completed the software development certification program at the Ogden Weber Tech College August of 2017.</p>
